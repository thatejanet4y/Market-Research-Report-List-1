<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Commercial Truck Tires Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Diagonal Tires</li><li>Radial Tires</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The commercial truck tires market primarily comprises two types: diagonal tires and radial tires. Diagonal tires, also known as bias-ply tires, have layers of fabric plies that crisscross, providing flexibility and a sturdy structure, making them suitable for off-road and rugged terrains. Radial tires, featuring plies arranged perpendicularly to the tire's direction, offer better fuel efficiency, enhanced traction, and increased durability on highways. The choice between these tire types influences performance, cost, and suitability for various trucking applications.</p></p>
